Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and high-heeled, buckled boots.
His blue eyes were light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.
