He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and high-heeled, buckled boots.

In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.
The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
